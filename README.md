# Othello
Othello python app  

*Note: It will probably take around a maximum of 10s for the AI to make a move. Since the possible moves for a Othello game is not a lot, I didn't limit the time the AI can use to make a move.*

*Small bug: If **AI** is selected and you want to stop it. You have to press **Stop*. And it might take some time before you can start the game again (because the AI is trying to make a move).*

Run (With Tkinter GUI):  
```
./othello.py
```
